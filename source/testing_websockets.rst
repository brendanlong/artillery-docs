Testing WebSockets
******************

Set the ``"engine"`` attribute of a scenario definition to ``"ws"`` to use WebSockets (the default engine is HTTP).

Two kinds of actions are supported: ``send`` and ``think``.

The underlying WebSocket client can be configured with a ``"ws"`` section in the ``"config"`` section of your test script. For a list of available options, please see `WS library docs <https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/master/doc/ws.md#new-wswebsocketaddress-protocols-options>`_.

Example
#######

::

  config:
    target: "wss://echo.websocket.org"
    phases:
      -
        duration: 20
        arrivalRate: 10
    ws:
      # Ignore SSL certificate errors
      # - useful in *development* with self-signed certs
      rejectUnauthorized: false
  scenarios:
    -
      engine: "ws"
      flow:
        -
          send: "hello"
        -
          think: 1
        -
          send: "world"


Inline variables, variables from CSV files can be used just like in an `HTTP scenario <testing_http.html>`_.

The WebSocket engine does not support parsing and reusing responses yet.
